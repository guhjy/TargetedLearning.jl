    "`treatment` is obviously the treatment variable. The outcome variable is `RE78` (earnings in 1978), and `RE75` is the pretreatment value at baseline. The others are potential baseline confounders. Check the link above for more information about the dataset.  We want to slice the matrix `dat` up to extract the treatment and outcome variable. Julia uses square brackets for indexing. The first dimension of a matrix is rows and the second is columns like R. If you want everything in one dimension, you put `:` (where as in R you can leave that dimension empty). You can index with booleans, integers, vectors of integers, ranges and some other things. Here are some examples:"
